# Reinforcement Learning Repository

This repository contains implementations of various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and techniques. RL is a branch of machine learning where agents learn to make sequences of decisions in an environment in order to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Categories of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

### 1. Model-Based vs. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
- **Model-Based RL**: Algorithms that utilize a model of the environment to plan actions.
- **Model-Free RL**: Algorithms that learn directly from interactions with the environment without explicitly modeling it.

### 2. Value-Based vs. Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning
- **Value-Based RL**: Methods that learn value functions to estimate expected return.
- **Policy-Based RL**: Approaches that directly learn policies (action selection strategies) without explicitly estimating value functions.

### 3. Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning
- Algorithms that combine aspects of policy-based and value-based RL by maintaining separate actor (policy) and critic (value function) networks.

### 4. Exploration-Exploitation Strategies
- Techniques for balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions based on current knowledge).

### 5. Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning
- Methods that learn by bootstrapping from other learned estimates, often using methods like SARSA or Q-Learning.

### 6. Monte Carlo Methods
- Algorithms that estimate value functions or policies by averaging sample returns over episodes.

### 7. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
- RL methods that leverage deep neural networks to approximate value functions or policies, enabling learning in complex environments.

### 8. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- Extends RL to scenarios where multiple agents interact with each other and the environment, requiring specialized algorithms like MADDPG or MARL.
