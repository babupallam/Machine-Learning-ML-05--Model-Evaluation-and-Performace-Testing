## Introduction

Model evaluation is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline. It ensures that your model performs well on unseen data and helps in selecting the best model for your application. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to evaluating machine learning models using a variety of metrics and techniques.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Metrics:** Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, and more.
- **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation techniques to assess model stability.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of different models using statistical tests.
- **Visualization Tools:** Visualize model performance with charts and plots.
- **Custom Metrics:** Easily implement and integrate custom evaluation metrics.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/model-evaluation-ml-models.git
cd model-evaluation-ml-models
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the evaluation scripts in this repository:

```python
from evaluation import evaluate_model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
results = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
print(results)
```

Check the `examples/` directory for more detailed use cases.

## Evaluation Metrics

This repository supports a wide range of evaluation metrics, including but not limited to:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Measures the ability of the model to capture positive cases.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC:** Measures the area under the ROC curve.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.

For a detailed explanation of each metric, refer to the [docs/metrics.md](docs/metrics.md) file.
